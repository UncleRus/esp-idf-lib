# ESP-IDF MJD HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor component
This is the component "mjd_hcsr501" for the ESP-IDF software framework for the ESP32 hardware from Espressif.

The software component "mjd_hcsr501" was originally developed for the HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor module hence its name. The data protocol of all modules are the same.

The component supports the following PIR motion sensor models:

- **HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor module** with lens. This module is fully configurable without having to solder/unsolder tiny SMD resistors. This was the original product that became very popular.
- **MH-SR602 Micro PIR motion sensor module** with lens (even smaller). The pin order is different (the pins on the PCB are labeled). This is currently the most popular PIR sensor and the data protocol is compatible with the HC-SR501. **Quiescent current: 20uA.**
- **AM312 Mini PIR motion sensor module** with lens (smaller). The pin order is different (the pins on the PCB are labeled). This module is very sensitive to noise and **not recommended** for new projects.



## Example ESP-IDF project(s)
`esp32_hcsr501_pir_sensor_using_lib` This project demonstrates the basics of using the MJD component "mjd_hcsr501".

`esp32_hcsr501_pir_sensor_deep_sleep_udp_using_lib` This project uses a PIR sensor to detect human movement in a room. The app wakes up when a movement has been detected and uploads a movement-detected message to a UDP Server. The app remains in deep sleep most of the time to minimize the power consumption. 



## Shop Product
- HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor module with lens. **Recommended** if you want to adjust the module manually (with the potentiometers).
- MH-SR602 Micro PIR motion sensor module with lens. **Recommended** but cannot be adjusted.
- AM312 Mini PIR motion sensor module with lens. **Not recommended** because it is very sensitive to noise.

### Sensor wiring up

Check the wiring scheme in the /_doc/ directory.

DEVICE PIN  MCU PIN
==========  =======
GND         GND
VCC         VCC 3.3V
DATA        GPIO#27 (Huzzah32 #27 bottomright-6)
```

- Bypass capacitor: connect a 100nF XR7 ceramic capacitor between the sensor pins VCC and GND; as close as possible to the sensor. Check the wiring scheme in the /_doc/ directory.
- CFB Low Pass Filter: connect a 100nF XR7 ceramic capacitor between the DATA pin of the sensor and GND. Connect a ferrite bead on the wire to the DATA pin of the sensor. 



A 10K pullup resistor for the DATA pin is not needed because the mjd_hcsr501 software component enables the ESP32's internal pullup resistor for that pin.



## Data Sheet
[Go to the _doc directory for documents and photo's.]



## Sensor Voltage Levels
- **Operating Voltage**: the specs say DC 4.5V-20V but the board also works with DC 3.3V (Ok for ESP32 boards).
- Voltage level on the **DATA PIN**: DC 3.3V (Ok for ESP32 boards).



## Data Pin Logic (no real protocol)
- DATA Pin logic: High 3.3V, Low 0V.
- The pin is HIGH (3.3V) when movement is detected (and stays so for X seconds during the time decay period). The time decay period is typically 2.5 seconds.
- The pin is LOW (0V) when no movement is detected.



## Sensor FAQ

- Sensing angle: 110 degrees.
- Sensing distance: 0.3 - 5 meter.
- Some models can be extended with **a LDR photoresistor model 5528 (bright=8-20 KiloOhm, dark=1 MegaOhm)** so that the module is only enabled when it is dark.
- The sensor is designed to adjust to slowly changing conditions that would happen normally as the day progresses and the environmental conditions change.
- The module contains the BISS0001 PIR motion detector IC. It processes the output of the analog sensor and transforms it in a digital signal.
- The HC-SR501 module contains the Holtek HT7133-1 regulator IC. It regulates the voltage 5V down to 3.3V.
- The sensor is only ready for use after 60 seconds after being powered-on. The sensor might output HIGH several times during that period. There should be as little motion as possible in the sensor's field of view during that period.
- The PIR (Passive Infra-Red) Sensor is a pyroelectric device that detects motion by measuring changes in the infrared levels emitted by surrounding objects. This motion can be detected by checking for a high signal on a single I/O pin. It measures heat levels so moving a wooden stick does not make it go *ON.
- The sensor is sensitive to strong light sources (sunlight) and sudden wind flow (air outlets, airco's).



## Time Decay potentiometer (only the HC-SR501 model)

- The pot on the left (see image).
- Defines how long the signal stays ON (and blocks further detections) after it has detected a movement. 
- Recommended setting: minimum 3 seconds.
- Minimum = 3 seconds (fully left).
- Maximum = 300 seconds(fully right).
- @important When the time decay ends then the motion detector is disabled for 3 seconds; the output signal will go Low.



## Distance Sensitivity potentiometer (only the HC-SR501 model)
- The pot on the right (see image).
- Implies how far the sensor works. Minimum: 3 meters. Maximum: 8 meters.
- Recommended setting: 3 meters.
- Fully left: max range 7 meter, increases sensitivity.
- Fully right: max range 3 meter, decreases sensitivity.




## Jumper "Trigger Mode" (only the HC-SR501 model)
- Recommended to use the Single trigger mode ("L").
- Modes:
  - Single Trigger Mode ("L"): output goes HIGH then LOW when triggered during the TIME DECAY period. Continuous motion results in repeated HIGH/LOW pulses. Output is LOW when idle.
  - Repeatable Trigger Mode ("H"): output remains HIGH when sensor is retriggered repeatedly during the TIME DECAY period. Output is LOW when idle.
- Jumper in the "L" position => uses Single Trigger Mode. Jumper-connect the two pins that are the closest to the corner of the board.

- Jumper in the "H" position => uses Repeatable trigger mode. Jumper-connect the two pins that are the furthest away from the corner the board.

## Reference: the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit SDK

Do you also want to create innovative IoT projects that use the ESP32 chip, or ESP32-based modules, of the popular company Espressif? Well, I did and still do. And I hope you do too.

The objective of this well documented Starter Kit is to accelerate the development of your IoT projects for ESP32 hardware using the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif and get inspired what kind of apps you can build for ESP32 using various hardware modules.
